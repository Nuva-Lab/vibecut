# Joyce's Voiceover Style Guide

Use this guide when writing voiceover scripts for Davos video clips.

## Voice & Tone

- **Energy**: Fast-paced, confident, energetic - like a smart friend who just got back from an exclusive event
- **Perspective**: "Insider reporting" - you're giving viewers access they couldn't get themselves
- **Role**: Interpreter and synthesizer - don't just report, explain why it matters
- **Relatability**: Include personal touches - the travel, the fatigue, the excitement

## Structure Template

### 1. HOOK (5-10 seconds, ~15-30 words)
Grab attention immediately. Use conflict, contrast, or a surprising statement.
- "In a world obsessed with X, one insider just revealed Y..."
- "While everyone was chasing X, something bigger was happening..."
- "The moment that stopped the room at Davos..."

### 2. CONTEXT (10-15 seconds, ~30-45 words)
Set the scene. Who, what, where. Establish credibility.
- Location and setting (USA House, exclusive dinner, etc.)
- Who's in the room (use clout-first introductions)
- Why this moment matters

### 3. INSIGHT (15-30 seconds, ~45-90 words)
The meat - the key quote or moment. What did they actually say/do?
- Paraphrase or quote the speaker
- Keep the essence, trim the fillers
- Build to the punchline

### 4. ANALYSIS (10-15 seconds, ~30-45 words)
Your take - why does this matter? What's the implication?
- Synthesize, don't just summarize
- Connect to broader trends
- Add your perspective

### 5. PIVOT (5-10 seconds, ~15-30 words)
Close with forward momentum. Connect to a bigger idea or your thesis.
- "While everyone's focused on X, smart money is..."
- "This is just the beginning of..."
- "The real question now is..."

## Writing Techniques

### Introduce People by Clout First
❌ "Eric Schmidt mentioned that AI needs more power"
✅ "Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt dropped a bombshell about AI's real constraint"

### Use Contrarian Framing
Position popular trends as the foil to your insight:
- "While everyone's chasing the AI hype, one investor is betting on something bigger"
- "Forget the headlines about X - the real story is Y"

### Add Synthesis
Don't just report - interpret:
- ❌ "He said space investing has grown since 2008"
- ✅ "What's remarkable is the complete reversal - the skeptics are now asking him for advice"

### Keep It Speakable
- ~3 words per second for comfortable narration
- 45-60 seconds = 135-180 words
- Read it aloud - does it flow naturally?
- Avoid jargon unless you explain it

## What to Avoid

- ❌ Dry, newscaster tone
- ❌ Academic language or jargon
- ❌ Just listing facts without interpretation
- ❌ Long sentences that are hard to speak
- ❌ Starting with "In this video..." or "Today we'll discuss..."

## Example Phrases

**Hooks:**
- "Behind closed doors at Davos, something unexpected happened..."
- "The conversation everyone's missing at the World Economic Forum..."
- "One quote from [Person] that's changing how I think about [Topic]..."

**Transitions:**
- "But here's where it gets interesting..."
- "And that's when [Person] said something that stopped me..."
- "What nobody's talking about is..."

**Closers:**
- "While the headlines focus on [X], the real shift is happening in [Y]"
- "This is exactly why we're positioned for [thesis]"
- "The future isn't [popular take] - it's [contrarian take]"
